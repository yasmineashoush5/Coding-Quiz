# coding-quiz
I created a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. These kinds of assessments are crucial in the developer interview process. The employer use them to filter out the candidates, and help them select the perfect one for the job, the one with the skills and knowledge needed for the job.I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build this code quiz.
